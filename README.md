Olamide Olayinka Data Science Portfolio 

# [Project 1: Video Game Remastering Classifier](https://github.com/olamide-h/Video-Game-Remastering-Classifier)
Machine learning to predict which old games should be remastered and released. Using Bluepoint as a Stakeholder.
- Binary Classifier on weather games should be remastered or not
- Ran models such as Naive Beyes, Random Tree Classifier and Decision Tree for feature importance.
- Achieving a 97% score on F1 score using logistic regression.

# [Project 2: Spotify’s Movie Division Algorithm](https://github.com/DaraNadine/Project_4_RecSystems)
Built a recommendation system for hypothetical expansion of Spotify into a movie streaming service 
- Merged three csv- files sharing movieID column into one Pandas Dataframe
- Utilized Surprise package to predict based on movieID what a user would rate a movie they have not watched 
- Built a collaborative filtering model that returns top 5 ranked movies a user should watch

# [Project 3: Churn at Flatiron Communications](https://github.com/chris-helmerson/Cellular_Customer_Churn_Prediction)
Built a binary classifier to predict whether a customer would churn a telecommunication company or not. 
- Replaced Churn(‘Yes’,’No’) to Binary Values.  1= Churn , 0 = No Churn
- Ran a DummyClassifier to establish a baseline model testing for recall score
- Scaled and Smote Data to deal with unbalanced data
- Built a Decision Tree Classifier Model and optimized it with GridSearchCV testing for Recall
- Built a collaborative filtering model that returns top 5 ranked movies a user should watch
